       Rule Header           |                          Rule Options 


----------------------------------
Action	

Action 
alert: Generate an alert and log the packet.
log: Log the packet.
drop: Block and log the packet.
reject: Block the packet, log it and terminate the packet session. 

Protocol	
Protocol parameter identifies the type of the protocol that filtered for the rule.
- Snort2 supports only four protocols filters in the rules (IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP)
- you can detect the application flows using port numbers and options. 
- if you want to detect FTP traffic, you cannot use FTP keyword in the protocol field but filter FTP traffic by investigating TCP traffic on port 21


======================================================================================
IP and Port Numbers

- these parameters identify the source and destination IP addresses and associated port numbers filtered for the rule.

IP Filtering	
alert icmp 192.168.1.56 any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet From "; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet originating from the 192.168.1.56 IP address.

Filter an IP range	
alert icmp 192.168.1.0/24 any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet originating from the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.

Filter multiple IP ranges	
alert icmp [192.168.1.0/24, 10.1.1.0/24] any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet originating from the 192.168.1.0/24 and 10.1.1.0/24 subnets.

Exclude IP addresses/ranges	
"negation operator" is used for excluding specific addresses and ports. Negation operator is indicated with "!"
alert icmp !192.168.1.0/24 any <> any any  (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each ICMP packet not originating from the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet.

Port Filtering	
alert tcp any any <> any 21  (msg: "FTP Port 21 Command Activity Detected"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to port 21.

Exclude a specific port	
alert tcp any any <> any !21  (msg: "Traffic Activity Without FTP Port 21 Command Channel"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet not sent to port 21.

Filter a port range (Type 1)	
alert tcp any any <> any 1:1024   (msg: "TCP 1-1024 System Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to ports between 1-1024.

Filter a port range (Type 2)	
alert tcp any any <> any :1024   (msg: "TCP 0-1024 System Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to ports less than or equal to 1024.

Filter a port range (Type 3)	
alert tcp any any <> any 1025: (msg: "TCP Non-System Port Activity"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to source port higher than or equal to 1025.

Filter a port range (Type 4)	
alert tcp any any <> any [21,23] (msg: "FTP and Telnet Port 21-23 Activity Detected"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
This rule will create an alert for each TCP packet sent to port 21 and 23.
 
---------
Direction

- indicates traffic flow to be filtered by Snort
- left side of the rule shows the source, and the right side shows the destination

-> Source to destination flow.
<> Bidirectional flow

===========================================
There are three main rule options in Snort;

1. General Rule Options 
- fundamental rule options for Snort

2. Payload Rule Options 
- rule options that help to investigate payload data
- these options are helpful to detect specific payload patterns

3. Non-Payload Rule Options 
- rule options that focus on non-payload data 
- these options will help create specific patterns and identify network issues


-----------------------
1. General Rule Options

Msg	
- The message field is a basic prompt and quick identifier of the rule. 
- Once the rule is triggered, the message filed will appear in the console or log. Usually, the message part is a one-liner that summarises the event.

Sid	
- Snort rule IDs (SID) come with a pre-defined scope, and each rule must have a SID in a proper format. 
- There are three different scopes for SIDs shown below.

<100: Reserved rules
100-999,999: Rules came with the build.
>=1,000,000: Rules created by user.
- rules we will create should have sid greater than 100.000.000
- Another important point is SIDs should not overlap, and each id must be unique

Reference
- each rule can have additional information or reference to explain purpose of rule or threat pattern
- that could be Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) id or external information
- having references for rules will always help analysts during alert and incident investigation

Rev	
- Snort rules can be modified and updated for performance and efficiency issues 
- rev option help analysts to have revision information of each rule
- it will be easy to understand rule improvements
- each rule has its unique rev number, and there is no auto-backup feature on rule history
- analysts should keep rule history themselves
- rev option is onl indicator of how many times rule had revisions

alert icmp any any <> any any (msg: "ICMP Packet Found"; sid: 100001; reference:cve,CVE-XXXX; rev:1;)

---------------------------------
2. Payload Detection Rule Options

a) Content	
- payload data
- it matches specific payload data by ASCII, HEX or both
- it is possible to use this option multiple times in a single rule
- more you create specific pattern match features, the more it takes time to investigate packet

Following rules will create an alert for each HTTP packet containing the keyword "GET". This rule option is case sensitive!
ASCII mode - alert tcp any any <> any 80  (msg: "GET Request Found"; content:"GET"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
HEX mode - alert tcp any any <> any 80  (msg: "GET Request Found"; content:"|47 45 54|"; sid: 100001; rev:1;)

b) Nocase	
- disabling case sensitivity
- used for enhancing content searches
alert tcp any any <> any 80  (msg: "GET Request Found"; content:"GET"; nocase; sid: 100001; rev:1;)

c) Fast_pattern
- prioritise content search to speed up payload search operation
- by default, Snort uses biggest content and evaluates it against rules
- "fast_pattern" option helps you select initial packet match with specific value for further investigation
- this option always works case insensitive and can be used once per rule
- note that this option is required when using multiple "content" options

The following rule has two content options, and the fast_pattern option tells to snort to use the first content option (in this case, "GET") for the initial packet match.

alert tcp any any <> any 80  (msg: "GET Request Found"; content:"GET"; fast_pattern; content:"www";  sid:100001; rev:1;)

-------------------------------------
3. Non-Payload Detection Rule Options

- there are rule options that focus on non-payload data
- these options will help create specific patterns and identify network issues

ID	
Filtering the IP id field.
alert tcp any any <> any any (msg: "ID TEST"; id:123456; sid: 100001; rev:1;)

Flags	
- filtering TCP flags
F - FIN
S - SYN
R - RST
P - PSH
A - ACK
U - URG
alert tcp any any <> any any (msg: "FLAG TEST"; flags:S;  sid: 100001; rev:1;)

Dsize	
- filtering packet payload size
dsize:min<>max;
dsize:>100
dsize:<100
alert ip any any <> any any (msg: "SEQ TEST"; dsize:100<>300;  sid: 100001; rev:1;)

Sameip	
Filtering the source and destination IP addresses for duplication.
alert ip any any <> any any (msg: "SAME-IP TEST";  sameip; sid: 100001; rev:1;)
